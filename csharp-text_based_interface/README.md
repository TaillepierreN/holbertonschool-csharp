## Text-based Interface
# Inventory Management Console App

A simple C# console application for managing inventories using all the C# and Foundations skills learned so far.

## ðŸ“¦ Overview

This project is a text-based interface for managing objects stored in an inventory system. Itâ€™s designed to be **flexible**, **extensible**, and **versatile** for various use cases. Users can create, read, update, and delete objects. All data is persisted using **JSON** files.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) objects  
- Store and retrieve inventory data from JSON files  
- Generic class and attribute names for flexible application logic  
- Customizable user prompts and object display  
- Emphasis on clean code, user feedback, and error handling

## ðŸ¤” Design Considerations

This app is built without strict specifications for input/output, encouraging real-world problem solving:

- You decide how input is handled (inline or step-by-step prompts)
- Object display is up to you â€” choose what makes sense and is readable
- Deletion can include a confirmation prompt for safety
- Helpful and descriptive error messages are expected
- Open design allows for easy extension and future improvements
